Greetings adventurer, I am the Great Wizard Oden!

No time to talk, we must go!
Not bad
Useless!
You are not so Weak
I Shall Taste your Blood!
There is a Forest ahead of you
You Are An Excellent Warrior!

Anyway, Finish that Filthy Mouse Off!
Well Done! You Killed One Of the Dark Captains!
The Other Dark Captain is a Strong Warrior
You Must be Careful! She is Really Evil!
You Shall now Continue Your Journey
What Am I doing Here?
I Was Escorting the King!
And he Got Kidnapped by a Powerful Wizard!
Seems Like I was Put Under a Powerful Spell
You Are Asking Who I Am?
I am Talene, One of The Kings Royal Guard
Come With Me, We Need To Save the King!
Kill Her! Not Me!
What Are You Doing?!
Are You Out Of Your Mind??!
