Mehira! Do you Know Where is The King?
Who is Mehira?
I am the Dark Knight Known as Kazz The Evil!
Kill Them All!
I am Badly Wounded, I Shall Hide and Heal
Looks Like Mehira is Also Under The Spell
I Remember I Woke Up The Moment You Defeat Me
You Need to Defeat Mehira to Wake Her Up!
We Need To Hurry!
If We Wait Any Longer, The King Will Be in Danger
What? Where Am I?
Talene, Where is The King? Where Are We?

We Need To Move! Time to Save The King!
You Are Strong Enough To Defeat Her
Defeat Me? You Must Be Joking! Take Care Of Him!
